OVERVIEW:
This project is a prototype of a DeepFake Detection Alert System. The system allows users to input a video of a person, then uses a face recognition pipeline integrated with an LLM to detect and analyze the person's face. It compares the detected face against a database of known deepfake content (including tagged images and videos collected from the internet).

If a match is found, the system triggers an alert, notifying the user of a potential threat and providing visual evidence as proof detection
